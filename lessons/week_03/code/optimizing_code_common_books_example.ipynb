This example in particular has a useful method you can use.\n","\n","Let me show you how I would approach this.

For example, in this case do you recall a data structure in Python that stores a group of unique elements and can quickly compute intersections and unions of different groups? You can read more about why sets are more efficient than lists for this task in the link on the bottom of this page.\n","\n","Also, remember how I said I googled everything?

And you can see the set being introduced here.\n","\n","This seems to have a lot of great explanation and votes, but ultimately we should try different methods and compare their efficiency for our example. Because different methods perform differently in different contexts. So it's smart to always test for yourself.
