- üéØ Week Goals 
	- Get ready to unlock your inner Data Science Ninja! ü•∑ This week is all about getting hands-on with the command line. Why? Because it's like the Swiss Army knife for any data scientist‚Äîversatile, indispensable, and oh-so-powerful!

**Week 03**
- [![Open in PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PDF-EC1C24?style=flat-square&logo=adobeacrobatreader)](https://github.com/ivanovitchm/mlops/tree/main/lessons/week_03/week_03.pdf) Clean Code Principles for Data Science and Machine Learning
- üéØ Week Goals 
    - This week is all about mastering the art of writing clean and efficient code. As a future data scientist or machine learning engineer, writing code that is both understandable and maintainable is crucial. We'll dig into principles like SOLID, DRY, and KISS, and see how they can be applied to data science and machine learning projects.
- üßπ Coding Best Practices
    - SOLID Principles: The SOLID principles are a set of five guidelines for object-oriented programming that can make your code more efficient and maintainable. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
    - DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself is a principle aimed at reducing the repetition of code patterns. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
    - KISS: Keep it Simple, Stupid is a design principle noting that systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- üìù Writing Clean Code
    - Variable Naming: Name your variables clearly to indicate their purpose. Short and vague names like `temp`, `x`, and `str` are usually not very informative.
    - Code Comments: While comments are useful, the best code is self-explanatory through clear structure and variable naming.
    - Consistency: Being consistent in naming conventions, indentation, and other stylistic choices makes it easier to read and maintain code.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring Code
    - What is Refactoring? The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)
    - When to Refactor? Common moments include after meeting a milestone, when fixing a bug, or in the process of adding a new feature.
- üöÄ Efficient Code
    - Time Complexity: Understanding the time complexity of your algorithms is crucial for handling larger data sets efficiently.
    - Space Complexity: Just like time, the amount of memory your program uses can also be a bottleneck.
